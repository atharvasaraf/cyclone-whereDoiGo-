## soft-Project
Our idea focuses on *reducing the number of people that get stranded in the event of cyclones*.
A significant amount of relief efforts are directed towards search-and-rescue operations for stranded persons in disaster affected areas.
Despite the establishment of cyclone shelters, majority of the population does not have a clue on their location and how to reach them. 
Issued red-alert warnings from local metrological departments do not reach large percentage of population through the media.
In addition to lack of prior intimation, most people do not have a concrete course of action when the cyclone strikes. The conventional steps taken to address above issues are too alien and easily forgotten.
We propose to connect to people more intimately through their smartphones in the hour of need. *Providing them with crucial information at their fingertips just a few hours before the natural disaster*.
We have conceptualized a **mobile-application** such that when triggered, provides the **route of the nearest cyclone** shelter to the user. This provides a light-weight solution to reducing damage to life in such situations. The cyclone shelters having their own power backup and supplies can then convey their **occupancy level** to disaster mangement committees. Which can help in *concentrating efforts and resource allocation*. For people who are unable to make it to such shelters, a record of their **last known location** can obtained from the app.
Search-and-rescue operations can now be channeled in these directions. Such as *dropping of flyers* directing persons to the nearest cyclone shelter. 

# Implementation
1. *Design of Application*
 * Application will show cyclone shelters in proximity.
 * By default, it will keep running in the background updating last known location of user.
 * The installation of this application must be made mandatory for all smartphone registered on the Mobile network.
 * Focus whilst building the application lies on making it light-weight, in terms of size and power consumed.

2. *Integration of Google Maps API*
 * This provides an efficient and familiar way of navigation.
